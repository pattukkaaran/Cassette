Kadhal Valarthen - I really did!

I can't find a better song to start this blog. 

But, wait. I suggest you to pick up your headphones and play this song as you read this blog post or blast your speakers with this song. Please! Let's go? 

Like I mentioned in my previous post, This is one song that changed everything for me. Like, Completely. If this song didn't happen to me, I would have not started the blog or Do what I am doing for a living right now (I mean my Job.. Polappu). This song shaped my life. This is one song I listen whenever I buy new headphones, Music Players. 

My love for this song started when I was sitting in the movie hall, smiling how Madhan and Vaishu got 'L' in FLAMES. I haven't listened to the song before. The song started, it calmed my soul. The soul of a very average 8th standard boy who had never been in love. Then, this song gave me an experience of gushing of love. The song runs for 7 minutes and 30 seconds, but not even once I have been bored of listening to this song. It's been 14 years since I listened to this song for the first time and it stays afresh for me. I fall in love everytime I listen to this song. I just close my eyes and sing my heart out. I don't remember anytime skipping 'Kadhal Valarthen..' whenever it popped in my shuffle or changing song in the middle of it. I listen to it completely. If I ever hear a glimpse of the song in TV or Radio, I stand & listen to the song completely and move around. 

I carry some (actually many) bittersweet memories with this song, but that doesn't make me stop listening to this number at any point of life. My love for this song is immortal and it grows bigger every time I listen to. 

Now, let's move to the Souls who sculpted the song. Yuvan Shankar Raja - Na Muthukumar - Kay Kay. I don't know who 'Okay-d' this Tune, Be it Simbu or A Jay Murugan.. Whoever it is, a BIG THANKS.

I had no clue, who Yuvan / Na Muthukumar were until this song crossed my path in life. I would have listened to the song more than some thousand times, but I still feel shivers when 

"Unadhu Per Ezudhi Pakkathile.. Enadhu Perai Naanum Ezuthi Vachen, Adhu Mazhayil Azhiyama Kudai Pudichen.. Mazhai Vittum Naan Nananjen.."

I remember singing this song to my History teacher in my 9th grade and he complimented me with a big smile 
"Nee Perungkaathalanaa Varuva." I don't know why he even said that. 

The beauty of this song is in the Strings Session, I believe. A song is a magic and you never know what makes a song work. The song has a simple, hummable tune; Simple, Deep Lyrics. Even though Kay Kay (the singer) is not too familiar with Tamil, he had emoted the love & pain of ‘Motta Madhan’.

I'm forever grateful to Yuvan, Na Muthukumar for this song!

I want to listen to this song in my death bed. You can play this at my funeral, I will rest in peace. I swear.

I'm with tears as I finish typing this, Not sure if they are happy or sad tears. 

See you guys soon with another song!
