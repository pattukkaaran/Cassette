The rituals are the same. Plug in your headphones and listen to the song as you start reading this post.

Well, I wonder where to start. I 'observed' this piece of art for the 1st time in 2014. Yea, that is 6 years after the movie released. Hope you're aware that the film released in 2008 & the song 'Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah..' was a huge hit. The song is grand and special thanks to Vijay Awards for making the song a mega-hit. Even though I follow Hindi songs and ARR's work in all languages, I didn't listen to this song. My bad, I take responsibility and I blame myself for missing such an earworm for 6 years!

There's an interesting (to me atleast) story how I found this song after 6 years. When I started working, I used to sit and coordinate with film designers for film publicity posters. I used to visit this famous designing office in Chennai and there was this man who was 5-6 years older than me. At work time he is super serious, I mean you can literally count the number of words he speaks in a day during work! But when everyone leaves office, he is a very different person. 'Muzhumadhi Avaladhu Mugamaagum..' slowly enters his song queue & he'd have it on loop for days! 'Ennamaa Eludhirukkan Paarunga Manushan..' is the prelude appreciation he'll start with & he'll go on exclaiming at every line, talking about his connection with that song.

I believe in cosmic connections & I think I'm destined to witness Na Muthukumar's presence (through his lines) at every point of my life :) I had no idea who penned this song when the designer anna praised the lyricist. But when I found out that it was Muthukumar, I wasn't surprised :) instead I'd always wonder how come he's the one who has penned of all my favourite songs :D

I really love the way this song flows into our ears... like still water in a spine-chilling hilly area. This one's such a pleasing earworm! :)

The song isn't constructed with some out-of-the-box words, but with simple/unpretentious words that will cling on to your mind for sometime. Even though the song is dubbed, the lyrics sit perfectly on the tune & rhythm of the song.

I feel the bitterness everytime I listen

"Urakkam Vandhe Thalaikodha.. Maraththadiyil Ilaippaari
Kan Thirandhen Avalum Illai.. Kasandhadhu Nimidam.."

தமிழில் (In Tamil)

"உறக்கம் வந்தே தலைகோத.. மரத்தடியில் இளைப்பாறி
கண் திறந்தேன் அவளும் இல்லை.. கசந்தது நிமிடம்.."
</pre>
Thank you, Oh Universe of Music! For ARR. For Na Muthukumar & for the eternal love :)

I hope you all adored this piece of art once again!

Yours truly, Pattukkaaran :)

& I hope you all fall in love with a person who makes you feel that the following lines from this song were written exclusively for you! :)

"கேட்டதுமே மறக்காத மெல்லிசையும் அவள்தானே..
அதன் பல்லவி சரணம் புரிந்து மௌனத்தில் நின்றேன்..!"
