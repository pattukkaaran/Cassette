Have you ever caught yourself humming a song that you hadn't listened to in the past few months? Like, the tune actually surprises you with a bang. That's the magic of music, right? You really can't get over a good piece of music. Even if the song carries some bitter memories, it stays with you.. somewhere in your subconscious mind. That's how I landed on this song this morning! It's been a while since I listened to it. After a sleepless, chaotic night, my brain helped my body rejuvenate by reminding me about this song.

Coming from the melody bank of Vidyasagar, Penned by Vairamuthu, this song holds a hell lot of memories. Composed for the Ajith, Jyothika starrer 'Poovellam Un Vasam'; Directed by Ezhil, this marks Ezhil's 1st and only association with Vidyasagar. No clue why the combo didn't return even though the songs of Poovellam Un Vasam was a huge hit back then.

This one is shot and edited according to the rhythm of the song (which is loosely like the sound of a train) & the visuals of this song is an icing on the cake.  Big-up to the DOP - Arthur A Wilson & Editor - Sreekar Prasad.

If you ask me to quote my favorite line from this song, I'd go on to quote the entire song but I'd like to pick a few lines which are soo close to my heart!

The charm of the song is in Shankar Mahadevan's flaaaaawless rendition IMHO. His voice adds soul & some sort of pain to this number but you know what sucks? Looking at my Vidysagar favorites and realizing that we never celebrated him enough. We never gave him the due recognition that he deserves. Of course, he got many biggies & he had enough films in his kit. But for the melodies he gave us & for his quality of music, he deserves to be celebrated big.

I remember spoiling a mix-tape that had this song in my school days! I recommend you to add this song to your 'Travel' playlist, Listen to this when you hit the road next time. I'm sure you are gonna think about that 'special one' throughout the song. Drop a text to them as soon as they occupy your mind! :)

I really hope this post made you revisit this lovely melody. See you all soon with another one from my тАЬfavouritesтАЭ collection! ЁЯЩВ Please write me your memories associated with this song. Would be really glad to readтАЩem! :)

Yours truly, Pattukkaaran :)
